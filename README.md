# Encryption Generator Project

This project is a showcase of my Python learning journey, combining my passion for programming and cybersecurity. Over the course of developing this project, I've created **four progressive versions**, each building on the previous to demonstrate growth and a deeper understanding of cryptographic concepts.

## Project Overview

The Encryption Generator Project focuses on encrypting and decrypting messages using different techniques, progressing from basic concepts to modern cryptographic standards. 

### **Versions**
1. **Version 1: Substitution Cipher**
   - Introduces basic encryption and decryption using a randomized substitution cipher.
   - Demonstrates foundational programming concepts like `for` loops and list operations.

2. **Version 2: Key Persistence & Input Validation**
   - Adds functionality to save and reuse an encryption key for multiple sessions.
   - Implements input validation to handle unsupported characters.

3. **Version 3: RSA Encryption**
   - Replaces the substitution cipher with RSA, a public-key encryption system.
   - Utilizes secure padding (`OAEP`) and hashing (`SHA-256`) for robust encryption.

4. **Version 4: Message Management & User Interface**
   - Allows saving encrypted messages to uniquely labeled files.
   - Introduces a menu-driven interface for better usability.
   - Enables retrieval and decryption of saved messages by label.
