# Version 1: Substitution Cipher

## Overview
This version introduces the basics of encryption and decryption using a simple substitution cipher. Each character in the input message is replaced by a character from a shuffled set of characters.

## Key Features
- **Basic Encryption/Decryption:** A straightforward implementation of a substitution cipher.
- **Randomized Key Generation:** A new key is generated every time the script runs, ensuring unique encryption for each session.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python version1.py
   
2. **Enter a Message to Encrypt:**

The script will prompt you to input a message. It will then display the encrypted version of the message.

3. **Enter a Message to Decrypt:**

You can enter the previously encrypted message to see the original message.

**Example**

Input: Hello, World!

Encrypted: %X1o*,&Jk/z8

**Learnings**

This version helped me understand the fundamentals of cryptography and how to use Python's random and string modules to manipulate data.
